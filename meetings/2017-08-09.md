## Minutes

* Next Meeting
    * Our September meeting will happen on Monday, September 11, 2017 so we can bring in a guest speaker from the Samvera community. Our guest speaker is Ben Armintor, Head of Development, Infrastructure and Applications at Columbia University and Fedora and Samvera committer (https://github.com/barmintor). Ben will speak about the archive project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to develop software to support oral histories, and to talk about how other Hydra/Samvera projects support oral histories and other time-based media.
